# PowerShell Script Obfuscator

This tool is a PowerShell script obfuscator implemented in Go. It provides various obfuscation techniques to make PowerShell scripts more challenging to analyze and reverse-engineer.

## Features

- **Base64 Encoding**: Encode the PowerShell script in Base64.
- **Layered Encoding**: Apply multiple rounds of Base64 encoding with additional transformations.
- **String Splitting and Reassembly**: Split the encoded script into parts and reassemble it.
- **NOP Insertion**: Insert random No-Operation (NOP) commands to confuse static analysis.
- **Control Flow Obfuscation**: Add fake branching to obscure the script's control flow.
- **Randomized Names**: Replace variable and function names with randomized strings.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/Algorora/PowerShell-Obufscator.git 
   cd Powershell-Obfuscator
   ```
## Build the Executable

Ensure you have Go installed. Build the Go script into an executable:
   ```sh
   go build obfuscator.go
   ```

## Usage

To obfuscate a PowerShell script, use the following command:
- **Obufscate a script**:
   ```sh
   ./obfuscator -script /path/to/your/script.ps1
   ```
- **Save output to a file**:
   ```sh
   ./obfuscator -script /path/to/your/script.ps1 > obfuscated_script.ps1
   ```
